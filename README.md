# 📊 E-commerce Customer Segmentation Pipeline

## 🚀 Project Overview
I developed an end-to-end data pipeline to process **1,000,000+ transaction records**. Using Python, I automated the data engineering process to identify high-value customer segments through **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis**.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **Data Engineering:** Developed a reusable cleaning script that processed 1M rows and filtered out 3,700+ erroneous records.
* **Relational Insights:** Successfully merged Fact and Dimension tables to unlock deep behavioral insights.
* **Statistical Visualization:** Generated Lifetime Value (LTV) distributions to visualize market concentration.
* **Business Automation:** Integrated an automated export system to provide stakeholders with Excel-ready reports.

## 📈 Business Impact
This tool enables marketing teams to increase ROI by specifically targeting "Champion" customers and creating re-engagement strategies for "At Risk" segments.
